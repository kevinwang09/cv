	%Passionate data scientist with a PhD in statistics and a proven track record of delivering valuable analytical insights. I am a highly effective communicator with numerous awards. I am highly skilled in developing machine learning models using the \texttt{R} language. 
	
	%\section{Profile}
	%
	%
	%Kevin is a research associate with a PhD in statistics from the University of Sydney in Australia. His main interest lies in the use of statistics and data science to uncover expected patterns in data to ultimately inform decision making. In his current role, his work focuses on statistical modelling of complex biological data and he provides consultations and analytical insights in various scientific fields. However, his specialisation in predictive modelling and applied statistical computation are applied broadly for data under any context. Kevin is a passionate and innovative data scientist and he loves talking with domain experts over whatever data problems they have on hand. His strong communication skills have been awarded with numerous prizes and scholarships throughout his career.
